		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A RESTful web service is a Web service implemented using HTTP and the principles of REST. Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture for distributed systems, introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/fielding/pubs/dissertation/restarchstyle.htm">his doctoral dissertation</a>. Fielding is one of the principal authors of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specification versions 1.0 and 1.1. The Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA) is a commonsense set of rules for designing RESTful Web services, introduced by Leonard Richardson et Sam Ruby in the book RESTful Web services.</p>

<h2 id="competing-web-service-architectures">Competing Web Service Architectures</h2>

<p>We can distinguish between three common Web service architectures: RESTful resource-oriented, RPC-style, and REST-RPC hybrid.</p>

<h3 id="restful-resource-oriented-architectures">RESTful, Resource-Oriented Architectures</h3>

<p>In RESTful architectures, the method information goes into the HTTP method. In Resource-Oriented Architectures, the scoping information goes into the URI. This is actually the main topic of this article.</p>

<h3 id="rpc-style-architectures">RPC-Style Architectures</h3>

<p>An RPC-style Web service accepts an envelope full of data from its client, and sends a similar envelope back. The method and the scoping information are kept inside the envelope. SOAP is a popular envelope format, generally put inside an HTTP envelope. Every RPC-style service defines a brand new vocabulary. By contrast, all RESTful Web services share a standard vocabulary of HTTP methods. Every object in a RESTful service responds to the same basic interface.</p>

<p>The Web is simple, based on the existing HTTP protocol. REST utilizes its methods and other existing features; SOAP RPC over HTTP, on the other hand, encourages each application designer to define new and arbitrary methods that supplant HTTP method.</p>

<h3 id="rest-rpc-hybrid-architectures">REST-RPC Hybrid Architectures</h3>

<p>REST-RPC hybrid architecture is a term made up by Richardson &amp; Ruby for describing Web services that fit somewhere in between the RESTful Web services and the purely RPC-style services. These services are clearly designed as RPC-style services (ones that use HTTP as their envelope format), despite the “REST” in the URI. The scoping information is in the URI, just like a RESTful resource-oriented service; but the method information also goes in the URI. In a RESTful service, the method information would go into the HTTP method, and whatever was leftover would become scoping information. Such a service is simply using HTTP as an envelope format, sticking the method and scoping information wherever it pleases.</p>

<h2 id="rest-and-resource-oriented-architecture-roa">REST and Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA)</h2>

<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>

<p>REST relies on the well-known, well-defined HTTP protocol, and heavily uses its properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>URIs (uniform resource identifier)</li>
  <li>Internet media types (MIME types or Content types)</li>
  <li>methods (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUT</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPTIONS</code>)</li>
  <li>response codes</li>
</ul>

<p>The resource-oriented architecture has the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>uniform interface: the method information is kept in the HTTP method</li>
  <li>addressability: expose at least one URI for every resource</li>
  <li>statelessness: every request happens in complete isolation (i.e. the server never relies on information from previous requests; application state resides in requests)</li>
  <li>connectedness: resources should link to each other in their representation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="resources-and-uris">Resources and URIs</h3>

<p>While <strong>RPC architecture</strong> (including SOAP) exposes <strong>internal algorithms</strong>, or verbs, <strong>ROA</strong> exposes <strong>internal data</strong>, or nouns (objects). In that sense, ROA may be considered as an “extreme object-oriented” architecture.</p>

<p>Requests and responses are built around the transfer of representations of <em>resources</em>. <strong>A resource can be essentially any coherent and meaningful concept that may be addressed</strong>, or in other words anything important enough to be referenced as a “thing”.</p>

<p>A resource must have at least one URI; the URI is the name and address of a resource.</p>

<p>A RESTful Web service exposes both its data and its algorithms through resources. URIs should be descriptive; there’s usually a hierarchy that starts out small and branches out into infinitely many leaf nodes. For algorithmic resource, query variables can be used.
Ex: /parent/child1;child?start=10</p>

<h3 id="http-methods">HTTP methods</h3>

<p>The HTTP method corresponds to the HTTP <em>verb</em>, or <em>action</em>, and indicates how the client expects the sever to process this envelope. The following methods are used:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>: retrieve information</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code>: create a new entry (from parent)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUT</code>: update an existing entry or create a new one (with all information)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE</code>: delete an existing resource</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code>: retrieve a metadata-only representation</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPTIONS</code>: check which HTTP methods a particular resource supports</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> method can be overloaded for some specific reasons, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>simulating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUT</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE</code> for clients that do not support them</li>
  <li>a workaround for max length URI (ex: Apache = 8KB)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="http-header">HTTP header</h3>

<p>The HTTP header is very helpful metadata when building resource-oriented Web services. It can give information about request authentication, encoding, (re)location, etc… without even inspecting the request body.</p>

<h3 id="http-response-codes">HTTP response codes</h3>

<p>HTTP response codes are very important; they tell the client how to deal with the object(s) in the entity body, or what to do if they can’t understand the it.</p>

<h3 id="media-types-format">Media types (format)</h3>

<p>REST is not tied up to any specific format. Usually though, common representations like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XML</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ATOM</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JPEG</code>, etc… are used, compressed or not.</p>

<h2 id="documenting-a-restful-web-service">Documenting a RESTful Web service</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state, or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types. Any effort spent describing what methods to use on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the scope of the processing rules for a media type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lack of a standard description language is often cited as a limitation of REST. In reality, machine-readable description languages do not communicate the semantics necessary for client developers to write code. Thus, most REST services are documented by no more than a textual description (a human-readable HTML file).</p>

<p>With version 2.0, WSDL supports all HTTP verbs and it is now considered to be an acceptable method of documenting REST services. An alternative is <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl/">WADL</a>, the Web Application Description Language, which is lightweight, easier to understand and easier to write than WSDL. However, WSDL and even WADL are usually considered to be an overkill.</p>

<p>A RESTful Web service documentation should fully describe the following in human readable description:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All resources, and methods supported for each resource.</li>
  <li>Media types and representation formats for resources in requests and responses.</li>
  <li>Each link relation used, its business significance, HTTP method to be used, and resource that the link identifies.</li>
  <li>All fixed URIs that are not supplied via links.</li>
  <li>Query parameters used for all fixed URIs.</li>
  <li>URI templates, and token substitution rules.</li>
  <li>Authentication and security credentials for accessing resources.</li>
  <li>For XML representations, if your clients and servers are capable of supporting XML schemas, use a schema language as a “convention” to describe the structure of XML documents used for representations in requests and responses. For other formats, use conventions to describe representations in prose (such as JSON schemas).</li>
</ul>
