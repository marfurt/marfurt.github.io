## Jekyll

The Website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Build the site and make it available on a local server (see `http://localhost:4000`):

	bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

Generate the site for production:

	bundle exec jekyll build


## Ruby

The Ruby version used for Gems is defined in `.ruby-version` and requires [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage other Ruby versions than the system one.
